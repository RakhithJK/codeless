# - Prepare jacoco agent to allow coverage report generation, build the project, and execute the unit tests:
#
#  mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install
# - To get coverage per tests information, you will need to activate the profile when running the instrumented tests:
#
#  mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install -Pcoverage-per-test
#
# - Analyze the project with SonarQube using Maven:
#
#  mvn sonar:sonar
